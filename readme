You need to enter your phone number. Pretty simple, right? :)

For every number, you need to complete some different 'tasks'.
The solutions are at the bottom of this text file, but I am sure you are smart enough you can figure it out alone.

Enjoy!

*Button 1
    After you press it, a lever will appear.

*Button 2
    After you press it, two moving squeres will appear.

*Button 3
    Pressed, a Trivia with 2 questions will be shown.
    Read each answer very carefull.
    Click the Submit button to submit your answer.
    After completing the Trivia, the number 3 will be inserted in the input box.

    For some options, there are some special responses.
        
        For each wrong answer, a meme will appear.

        Question 1 - nothing really awesome here.
        Question 2 - Option 3 - a really remarkable picture with Putin *insert photo here - putin.jpg*.

*Button 4
    After you press it, a black color button will appear.
    Press it to continue with another button like this. x3.

*Button 5
    Pressed, 3 sliders, a robot hand and a reddit reward will be shown.
    Touch the reward with the finger of the arm using the range sliders.

*Bottom 6
    After you press it, 6 Reddit votes will appear.

*Bottom 7
    To insert number 7, you need to get the "exclusive" code from the another site, and paste it in the text box.

*Bottom 8
    It's a riddle because why not..

*Bottom 9
    After you press it, a red button will appear.
    Press it!

*Bottom 0
    Click the bottom to insert number 2, of course.

<!-- Solution --!>

*Button 1: Click the lever to insert number 1 in the input box.

*Button 2: Click both squeres to insert number 0*. It can be tricky, but don't give up.
                                *IT'S A FEATURE, NOT A BUG.
*Button 3: 
    -Question 1: "All of above".
    -Question 2: "Floating point exception (core dumped)".

*Button 6: Collect the upvotes and the downvotes to insert number 6.

*Button 7: Code: "1KuM9vV".

*Button 8: Type in "javascript".

*Button 9: You need to press the button 99 times, because is mildly infuriating.
